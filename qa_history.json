    "question": "4. What considerations do you take when choosing between traditional ML and deep learning models?",
    "answer": "The choice between traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning models depends on several factors. One significant consideration is the nature of the data available. If the data is structured, has a clear and simple pattern, and involves less uncertainty, then traditional ML might be more appropriate. However, if the data is unstructured, complex, or involves high degrees of ambiguity, deep learning models, particularly neural networks, may yield better results due to their ability to learn complex patterns from large amounts of data.\n\nAnother important factor is computational resources. Deep learning models often require significant computational power and large amounts of training data,",
